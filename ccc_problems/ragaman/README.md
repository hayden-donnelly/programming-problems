## Problem Description
An anagram of a string is formed by rearranging the letters in the string. For example, the anagarams of aab are aab, aba, and baa.

A wildvcard anagram of a string is an anagram of the string where some of the letters might have been replaced with an asterisk (\*). For example, two possible anagrams of aab are \*ab and \*b\*.

Given two strings, determine whether the second string is a wildcard anagram of the first string.

## Input Specification
The first two lines of input will both consist of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) characters. Each character in the first line will be a lowercase letter. Each character in the second line will be either a lowercase letter or an asterisk.

For 8 of the 15 available marks, the second line will not contain any asterisk characters.

## Output Specification
Output the character A if the string on the second line is a wildcard anagram of the string on the first line. Other wise, output the character N.
