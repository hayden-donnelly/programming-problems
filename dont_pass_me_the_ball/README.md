Problem is from the Canadian Computing Competition's online grader.

## Problem Description

Players have jerseys numbered from 1 to 99 (and each jersey number is worn by exactly one player).

Given a jersey number of the goal scorer, indicate how many possible combinations of players can produce a valid goal.

## Input Specification
The input will be the positive integer J (1 ≤ J ≤ 99), which is the jersey number of the goal scorer.

## Output Specification
The output will be one line containing the number of possible scoring combinations that could have J as the goal scoring jersey number.
