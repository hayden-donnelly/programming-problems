      <h2>Commencement</h2>
      <p>
        “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, <br />to
        front only the essential facts of life, <br />
        and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, <br />
        and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. <br />
        I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; <br />
        nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite
        necessary.<br />
        I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, <br />
        to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not
        life, <br />
        to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner,
        <br />
        and reduce it to its lowest terms...”

      <h2>O Captain! My Captain!</h2>
      <p>
        O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br />
        The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br />
        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br />
        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br />
        But O heart! heart! heart!<br />
        O the bleeding drops of red,<br />
        Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br />
        Fallen cold and dead.<br /><br />
        O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br />
        Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br />
        For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br />
        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br />
        Here Captain! dear father!<br />
        This arm beneath your head!<br />
        It is some dream that on the deck,<br />
        You’ve fallen cold and dead.<br /><br />
        My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br />
        My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br />
        The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br />
        From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br />
        Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br />
        But I with mournful tread,<br />
        Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br />
        Fallen cold and dead.<br />

      <h2>Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field one Night</h2>
      <p>
        Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;<br />
        When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,<br />
        One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall
        never forget,<br />
        One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the
        ground,<br />
        Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,<br />
        Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my
        way,<br />
        Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of
        responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)<br />
        Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the
        moderate night-wind,<br />
        Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field
        spreading,<br />
        Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,<br />
        But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,<br />
        Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin
        in my hands,<br />
        Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest
        comrade—not a tear, not a word,<br />
        Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my
        soldier,<br />
        As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,<br />
        Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your
        death,<br />
        I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely
        meet again,)<br />
        Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn
        appear’d,<br />
        My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form,<br />
        Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully
        under feet,<br />
        And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in
        his rude-dug grave I deposited,<br />
        Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field
        dim,<br />
        Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth
        responding,)<br />
        Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day
        brighten’d,<br />
        I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his
        blanket,<br />
        And buried him where he fell.<br />
