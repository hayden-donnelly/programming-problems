# Voronoi Villages

## Problem Description
In the country of Voronoi, there are N villages, located at distinct points on a straight road. Each of
these villages will be represented by an integer position along this road.

Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other
village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages A and B is in the niehgbourhood of A and also
in the neighbourhood of B.

Each neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.

Determine the smallest size of any neighbourhoods (with exactly 1 digit after the decimal point).

## Input Specification
The first line will contain the number N (3 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of villages. On the next N lines there will be one integer per line, where the ith line contains the integer V<sub>i</sub>, the position of the ith village
(-1 000 000 000 ≤ V<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1 000 000 000). All villages are at distinct positions.

## Output Specification
Output the smallest neighbourhood size with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

## Sample Input
```
5
16
0
10
4
15
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
3.0
```

## Explanation for Output for Sample Input
The neighbourhoods around 0 and 16 are infinite. The neighbourhoods around 4 is 5 units (2 to the left, and 3 to the right). The neighbourhood around 10 is 5.5 units (3 to the left and 2.5 to the right). The neighbourhood around 15 is 3.0 units (2.5 to the left and 0.5 to the right).
